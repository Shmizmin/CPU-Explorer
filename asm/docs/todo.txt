parsing macros:
	find macro initialization sequence,
		then parse each statement and store all tokens (in statement form) via pointer (?),
		then when macro is invoked, assemble each of those statements in place

todo this:
	must delegate statement processing and assembling off to another function entirely
		parameters: statement pointer, code segment vector reference, write head reference
		return res: void or success flag
		side effects: assembles the statement into the code at the write head's location

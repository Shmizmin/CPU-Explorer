CPU-Explorer is an assembler, emulator, and diassembler for a virtual processor all bundled into a tiny piece of software. It's architecture and design choices follow in the likes of the 6502, the 68000, the 808x, and the Z80. The assembly has a very simple syntax, and there is an integrated debugger and watch for the emulator.
